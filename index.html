    <h1>Browsing Insights</h1>
    <p class="subtext-b">Keywords: Chrome Extension, Chrome API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
    <div class="project-pic">
      <img src="images/bi.png" alt="Browsing Insights"/>
    </div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>"Browsing Insights" offers practical features for users looking to track and analyze their browsing histories. 
        It includes an advanced search function, a smart tracking system with customizable filters for date, time, and domain, 
        and a 'Visit Trends' feature that provides graphical insights into website visit counts over different time periods. 
        Ideal for users who want a clear overview and a better reflection of their online activity. Available for installation from the
        <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/browsing-insights/bfmammhikjndhdpnlldacijbmnlmjbii"><u>Chrome Web Store</u></a>.</p>
    <h2>About this Study</h2>
      <p>Default browser history tools fall short in terms of functionality and flexibility for users seeking deeper insights into their 
      browsing activities, standard browser history tabs like those in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge only provide a chronological list
      of visited sites, lacking functionalities for <span class = "highlight">flexible navigation</span> and <span class = "highlight">
      reflective practices</span>. Seeing this gap, this study aimed to develop an extension to the Google Chrome browser which not only 
      logs users' histories but offers features that assist with flexible, site-based tracking and gaining a deeper understanding of 
      online activities through data visualization. It has capabilities for searching, sorting, customizable record-tracking by date, 
      time, or site domain, and graphical displays of site visits across different time frames.</p>
      <p>On the technical side, the tool was developed with Chrome history API for data retrieval, and considerations were given to the 
      overall layout and functionalities of the extension. <span class = "highlight">User-friendly features</span>, such as infinite scrolling, debounced search,
      and suggestion lists for typed information were integrated. Guidance was provided on the homepage, and error prevention 
      mechanisms were embedded for various user inputs. Further, users had viewing options for the data visualization of stacked or 
      non-stacked comparative bar charts. For flexibility, users could also decide which site or sites they wanted to include or 
      exclude from their tracking.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive examination of Netflix Original productions,  
          leveraging data scraped from IMDb and focusing on their proliferation, audience reception, and thematic diversity from 2012 to 2023. 
          The primary focus of this research is on data scrapping and visualization, aiming to illustrate patterns in <span class = "highlight">production volume, genre 
          popularity, and perceived quality </span>through IMDB ratings. It seeks to provide insightful visual representations and to understand trends 
          and preferences in Netflix Original content, highlighting the types of content that resonate with audiences and how Netflix's content 
          creation strategies align with viewer preferences.</p>
        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p>
          The number of Netflix original productions exhibited a steady increase from 2012 to 2020, peaking in 2022 before experiencing a 
          slight drop in 2023. From 2017 to 2020, each genre saw growth in production, with drama and comedy showing the most significant 
          increases. Genres such as war, talk shows, westerns, and musicals remained relatively stable from 2017 to 2023. Following the peak
           in 2022, all genres experienced a drop in 2023, except for history and thriller, which saw a noticeable increase</p>

        <p>The most prevalent content ratings among the shows were MA15+/M (for mature audiences). Despite the variation in ratings, 
          there was no significant differentiation in IMDb scores. Genre-wise, IMDb scores varied, with history and war receiving the 
          highest scores, while horror and romance received the lowest.</p>

        <p>The most produced genres, including Drama, Comedy, Documentary, and Crime, align with those seen in the top 10 voted programs on 
          IMDb each year from 2012 to 2023. However, IMDb scores for these top-voted programs have declined in recent years, compared to before
           2016. Word clouds associated with these popular programs revealed themes such as "world", "new", "relationship", "father", and 
           "friends". 
        </p>
        <p>Each year, the top 10 programs with the highest IMDb ratings predominantly fell into genres such as Drama, Comedy, Crime, and 
          Animation. Their descriptions commonly included keywords like 'family,' 'child,' 'protagonist,' and 'friend.</p>

    <h1>Hotel Booking Analysis (PowerBI)</h1>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>An overall analysis of hotel bookings from 2015 to 2017 reveals that demand was highest in 2016, with the City Hotel consistently 
      more in demand than the Resort Hotel. August saw the peak in room requirements across all types, boasting the highest average nightly
       rates. January featured the highest occupancy rates, while April and June experienced the highest cancellation rates annually. 
       About 90% of guests opted for rooms without a deposit requirement, and over 80% booked through travel agencies (TA/TO). 
    </p>

      <figcaption>Sample Dashboard</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>Analyzing successful bookings and stays, room types A and D were most popular. Occupancy rates peaked at the end of each month. 
      Canceled bookings had an average confirmation time of 3.6 days, and bookings made three months in advance had the highest 
      cancellation rates.
    </p>

    <p>For Resort Hotel, demand in July was higher than City Hotel for both weekdays and weekends, with the highest nightly rates observed 
      in July and August, signaling peak season with maximum room demand. Conversely, January had the least demand with the lowest rates, 
      denoting the off-season, with weekday demand surpassing weekend. In February, repeat visitors were most likely to cancel bookings, 
      which often underwent changes before cancellation, while September saw the most instances of repeated cancellations.

    <h1>Twist-Con</h1>

    </div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The objective of this project was to design a controller that<span class = "highlight"> enhances haptics for VR experiences.</span> Traditional VR controllers,
      while designed to accommodate the most common use cases and interactions, fall short in delivering realistic haptic feedback for specific 
      scenarios. That's where Twist-Con comes into place: a VR controller specifically designed to simulate the haptic sensations associated with 
      various <span class = "highlight">twisting motions</span> and scenarios.</p>
    <div class="project-pic">
      <img src="images/gif1.gif" alt="Twsit Con"/>
      <figcaption>Controller w/o realistic haptic feedback</figcaption>
    </div>
    <h2>About this Study</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of the controller is a hobby motor with a built-in encoder, which utilizes PID control logic to achieve the haptic feedback of resistence torque. This 
        system is programmed using Arduino and a UNO board. To house the hobby motor, the controller's body is constructed from laser-cut plywood pieces that tessellate to secure the motor. This 
        assembly is enhanced by a living hinge pattern on the arm holder for added flexibility and comfort. Additionally, three types of 
        3D-printed knobs can be mounted atop the motoe's shaft, enabling users to engage with twisting actions on objects of various shapes.
